        <h1>Dear TicaðŸ’–</h1>
            <p>
                Honestly, I don't know how to start this letter for u. Because I never wrote a letter for anyone before but I 
                hope u enjoy this letter.
            </p>

            <p>
                Tica, first of all I wanna say thank you for coming to my life after a long time we lost contact. 
                I dont know what will happen if you dont send me that DM and dont get notified. Will we be who we are now? I dont know HAHAHAH.
                But your presence means a lot for me. I am very grateful that you've come into my sad life and you bring my life back.
            </p>

            <p>
                I just want you to know that there's no one else except you in my heart. If I could make a promise,
                I would promise that I'll set my heart for you, yeaaa only for you Tica. But if i only make a promises, it wouldn't be
                enough right? So I'll prove it then. I would stay away from another girl even tho thats my bestfriend (girl), 
                hope you do the same cuz you know right that I hate being jealousy. I always jealous when I'm not with you, 
                even less when you're around other guys, I feel gloomy. I just don't want to waste you nor waste our relationship.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also want to apologize for what I have done in the past. I want to apologize for disappointing 
                you in the past. If I could turn back time, I want to be with you from then on. Sorry I'm not that perfect.
            </p>

            <p>
                I don't know if im worth it or nah. To think that a girl as amazing, smart, gorgeous, caring, and 
                CUTE AF would ever fall for someone like me, it's sounds like a fairy tale. My whole day is basically 
                me looking at ur cute pics and videos pretending to hold ur hand doing anything I can to be with 
                you and hoping you're doing alright. I don't ever wanna lose my ticaaa. I don't ever wanna call you my x â˜¹, 
                just stay with me please. I never wanna have fights with you. I'll always try to minimize the chance that we'll fight.
            </p>

            <p>
                I want you. I need you most. I love you. I could never love a person the way I love you, I need you 
                to trust me and trust that I would never care for anyone as much as I care for you. I need ur cute face, I need
                ur cute voice, I need ur hugs, I need you, and I always miss you. Im so happy that I can call you my gurl, my baby, my ayang, 
                my world, my ticaaa, my everything. You'll forever be my one and only. And I hope I could be yours too.
            </p>
